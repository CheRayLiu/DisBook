# Social Connect
**This discord bot uses the Facebook and Discord API.**
In order to use this bot, you must have the facebook module and discord.py modules installed.
You must also be able to run the program in a terminal. We are planning to eventually host the bot on a server so you will be able to add it that way instead.

When using the bot for the first time, use the command !setPost in the desired channel in order to tell the bot that this is where you would like all announcements to be posted. 

After doing so, one must simply send the bot a private message and the desired actions will be performed within the set channel.

**The bot will only recognize the command if it is sent by private message.**

Usage:

- **!setPost** - sets the desired channel for announcements to be made
- **!post [message]** - posts entered message to predetermined facebook page.
- **!read** - reads latest post from Facebook page and posts it in desired channel.
